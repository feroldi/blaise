# Blaise

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/feroldi/blaise.svg?token=FjPQjKrsmeJzM46SGssn&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/feroldi/blaise)

Blaise is my university's compilers class project.
The name is inspired on the mathematician Blaise Pascal's first name, given the language chosen to be compiled by Blaise is a modification of Pascal's syntax grammar.

## Building

Blaise is written in Rust, so you may use its package manager, `cargo`, to build and run it:

    cargo build
    cargo test
    cargo run <some source file>

## Language grammar

Grammar definition of blaise is found at the `grammar.bnf` document.
